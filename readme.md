# DrrrAsync

**Unless a personal need requires it, I will not be patching DrrrAsync further. Unless Drrr.com has breaking API changes, DrrrAsync is in a finished state.

I will accept new features from pull requests, provided they do not hamper the client's overall stability.**

DrrrAsync is a Client/Bot framework for a Drrr.com, a 'DOLLARS' style chatsite inspired by the anime Durarara.

The structure of DrrrAsync's 'Bot' class is very similar DSharpPlus to maximize compatibility of modules and functions.
For the most part, any functions you write for your discord bot, are easily portable to DrrrAsync.
